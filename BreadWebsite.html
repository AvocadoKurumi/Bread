            Bread Poem

            From humble grain, a staff of life,
            A simple thing, yet filled with strife.
            The baker's touch, the oven's heat,
            Transforming flour, a golden feat.

            The crust, a crown, a crackling shell,
            Within, the crumb, a story tells.
            Of patient rise, of gentle knead,
            A comfort food, a daily need.

            With buttered warmth, or jam's embrace,
            A canvas bare, a flavor space.
            For soup's companion, sandwich's heart,
            In every bite, a work of art.

            Through famines past, on plenty's shelf,
            A symbol shared, of life itself.
            So break a piece, and share the crust,
            This staff of bread, a bond of trust.

            If - Bread Lyrics
        </h2>
        <pre style="text-align: center; padding-right: 3%; font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium;">
            If a picture paints a thousand words
            Then why can't I paint you?
            The words will never show the you I've come to know
            If a face could launch a thousand ships
            Then where am I to go?
            There's no one home but you
            You're all that's left me to
            And when my love for life is running dry
            You come and pour yourself on me

            If a man could be two places at one time
            I'd be with you
            Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way
            If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die
            I'd spend the end with you
            And when the world was through
            Then one by one the stars would all go out
            Then you and I would simply fly away
